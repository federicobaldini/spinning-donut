# Rust Spinning Donut
I rewrote in Rust the popular spinning donut code originally created in C. Just run the application with this command on your terminal:
```
cargo run
```
and a donut will start spinning on your console.

If you don't have Cargo installed, run this command on your terminal if you start form the project root:
```
./src/main
```
or just 
```
./main
```
if you are inside the spinning-donut/src folder.
